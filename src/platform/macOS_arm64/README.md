# macOS ARM64 platform

This directory contains the native macOS ARM64 build entry point and is the
home for future macOS-specific implementations. The build compiles every C++
translation unit below `src/` except for the Windows-only
`src/platform/Windows_x64` subtree.

Run it on Apple Silicon macOS with:

```sh
bash src/platform/macOS_arm64/build.sh
```

Objects and the build manifest are written to `obj/macOS_arm64`. The portable
test runner is written to `out/macOS_arm64/AltirraPortableTests`. Object reuse
is content-based, so a restored GitHub Actions cache remains useful after a
fresh checkout with different file timestamps.
